5.0 out of 5 stars,Just missing the headphone jack. No lagging after 4 months of use. Oxygen OS works like a charm. So clean and fast. Wrap charge is definitely an advantage and battery lasts for the full day. Pretty light weight. Camera works perfectly. Just a heating issue when you are out in a sun.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Even I had some concerns about indisplay fingerprint reader before buying this product but after using it for 2 weeks now, it seems that the fingerprint reader works same as the physical fingerprint reader. Though it may seem like indisplay fingerprint reader is slow but trust me it's the same blazing fast speed when I compared it with one plus 6."

3.0 out of 5 stars,Picture quality is good. Face recognition is good.Phone overall is good. But I am facing phone heat problem sometimes.64 & 128 GB ram configuration is not useful when the phone is getting heated.Memory is just 30percent used.still my phone is heated. Not happy. 38000 wasted on this phone.
5.0 out of 5 stars,It's fast processing
4.0 out of 5 stars,To be honest the phone McLaren is good but the phone does not seem to have 10 GB RAM instead you can buy a normal oneplus 6t with 8GB RAM. The phone is absolutely good but not worth to be a 50000 . U may buy a normal one.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"All those who have bought it, are set for atleast next 3 years. Unbeatable phone!"

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worst experience ever.. I didn't expect this from oneplus one which calls itself as flagship killer.. the first phone which I bought had excessive heating issues on usage of camera; I got it replaced as after verification it was confirmed that the phone is defective.. now the 2nd phone which I got as a replacement is also have heating issues.. but this time while phone is in charge.. I called CS again and explained about my issues.. after downloading blancco diagnostic app it was confirmed that the phone heata up when in charge.. on normal usage the temperature of this is around 34-35 degree C, but when in charge it will be increased to 41-42 degree.. but the technician who was on call for support argued with me that 42 degree C is normal temperature for any phone.. excuse me oneplus and amazon, I didn't pay money for a phone which heats up when in charge.. this is not some dabba phone.. this is one plus sir.. m extremely disappointed with performance as well.. this phone hangs up on excessive usage of camera.. 4k camera zoom doesn't work all time and if I try to do it automatically exit from camera and go to home page(surprisingly it changed my wallpaper as well).. not happy with the performance of this phone.. paid 38k and bought it through EMI with a hope that I'll get a good phone.. but the scene is different here and even amazon can't help it even after verification.. m writing this big review here with a home of getting any response from the merchant.. I agree everyone is not facing this issue but not all oneplus 6T is perfect.. I m very unlucky to get 2 defective phones.. I hope amazon will help me out with this: PLEASE TRY TO RESOLVE PROBLES OF CUSTOMER AND DON'T CONVINCE OR CONFUSE THEM‚òπÔ∏èüôè"

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Obivously the Oneplus 6T is an amazing phone and the FREE next day delivery just made my Day. But The ANNOYING part is I ordered a MIDNIGHT BLACK variant but got a THUNDER PURPLE variant. I do accept that I like thunder purple but Midnight black is what I preferred. and the package details also mention it as Midnight black. I didn't want to return the product as it is a time taking process. Anyways not denying the fact that it is an AMAZING PHONE, AMAZON should Double check the product details before delivery."

4.0 out of 5 stars,The phone one plus 6t is.  water proof and bust proof??? Or something else I want to know thats why
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the phone today. I started the phone and booted the phone. I registered only one fingerprint on the phone. i.e. My left thumb. While I was showing the phone to my colleagues, one of my friend's right thumb was able to open the phone even though the said thumb is not registered. Shocked to see this. One plus needs to look into this security issue. I have not written a detailed review."
