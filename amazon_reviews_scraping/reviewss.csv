1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worst experience ever.. I didn't expect this from oneplus one which calls itself as flagship killer.. the first phone which I bought had excessive heating issues on usage of camera; I got it replaced as after verification it was confirmed that the phone is defective.. now the 2nd phone which I got as a replacement is also have heating issues.. but this time while phone is in charge.. I called CS again and explained about my issues.. after downloading blancco diagnostic app it was confirmed that the phone heata up when in charge.. on normal usage the temperature of this is around 34-35 degree C, but when in charge it will be increased to 41-42 degree.. but the technician who was on call for support argued with me that 42 degree C is normal temperature for any phone.. excuse me oneplus and amazon, I didn't pay money for a phone which heats up when in charge.. this is not some dabba phone.. this is one plus sir.. m extremely disappointed with performance as well.. this phone hangs up on excessive usage of camera.. 4k camera zoom doesn't work all time and if I try to do it automatically exit from camera and go to home page(surprisingly it changed my wallpaper as well).. not happy with the performance of this phone.. paid 38k and bought it through EMI with a hope that I'll get a good phone.. but the scene is different here and even amazon can't help it even after verification.. m writing this big review here with a home of getting any response from the merchant.. I agree everyone is not facing this issue but not all oneplus 6T is perfect.. I m very unlucky to get 2 defective phones.. I hope amazon will help me out with this: PLEASE TRY TO RESOLVE PROBLES OF CUSTOMER AND DON'T CONVINCE OR CONFUSE THEM‚òπÔ∏èüôè

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was too much impressed by my earlier One Plus 5T, that I upgraded it to 6T. Though all the features are exactly as they are claimed to be with super easy data transition due to a default app called OnePlus switch everything got sync with my new phone, including call history, wall paper, apps loaded & SMS etc.Only problem is that there is no exploring excitement because it does'nt look like a new phone. Both phone look & feel exactly same except relocation of buttons which shall take some time to bring in the habit. New phone is felt slightly thicker in hands. Screen area is more, finger print sensor is funky.But the bottom line is, my next phone too shall be One Plus only.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall: 8/10:A fantastic package at good value. 6T McLaren is'nt much different from the standard 6T except for the RAM and some minor cosmetic changes. But for a long time fan of the Silver Arrows from Mika Hakkinen's time, a small increase in price was worth it. Call me sentimental! :)Unboxing & contents: 8/10One of the coolest unboxing experiences. The McLaren box is very premium and the booklet starts with giving you a brief glimpse into the history of the brand and some cool pictures from the archives. It is an homage to Bruce McLaren to be honest. The Speed Mark (real Carbon Fire cutout of the McLaren logo) encased in acrylic is pretty good and can serve as a cool table top accessory or paper weight. If not for much it can be a good ice breaker for visitors to your home / office. The Charger and Cable are also customized for the McLaren edition. The Soft PU case is simple black and fits snugly. There was a missed opportunity to throw in some colour for the McLaren edition. All else is pretty much standard. Providing only a USB-C to 3.5 converter is a bummer. For the flagship offering at over 50K, throwing in a Bullet Earphone should have been standard.First Impressions: 9/10The device is actually pretty impressive looking. Especially the orange accents at the Bezel on the back. When you change the angle under light, it almost looks like there are LEDs inside. It looks premium for sure though an actual Carbon Fibre body would have been awesome! Be warned though that the surface is a fingerprint magnet and not easy to wipe off unless you use a good cleaning spray. The Waterdrop notch is barely noticeable and is not much of an issue. The colours are vibrant and while setting up you can choose a profile that suits your taste.Setup: 8/10The SIM Card tray is a standard two Nano-SIM one. No SD Card support still! But with 240 GB usable memory, not much of an issue to be honest. I used the OnePlus switch app to transfer my apps, data and settings. The transition was hassle free and took all of 15 minutes. Most apps worked immediately but a few needed to be uninstalled and reinstalled as they were acting up. I gave it a point less as I think the OnePlus Switch app should be integrated at the setup stage instead of making a new user download it. The phone heats up considerably but it was fine after the initial 30 minutes.Battery: 7/10The unit came with 50% power out of the box and it took me a good 30 minutes to get it to 75% despite using the Warp Charge @ 30W. Probably it was due to the fact that close to 100 apps were being downloaded while it was charging. I will check the charging performance over the next few weeks and update review if required.Performance: 9/10Gaming: Initial performance on gaming is very very good (Asphalt 9 Legends and Real Racing 3). Zero lag and super smooth rendering.  Bloons TD6 is a very resource hungry at lategame levels and the 6T McLaren  made short work of it.Display: The display is really mind-blowing. Video on Youtube and other streaming apps was super smooth and brilliant to look at. One cool feature is that you can pinch zoom the content to include / exclude the waterdrop notch for front camera.  Adaptive brightness is annoying at times and I had to turn it off while playing the racing games.Camera: Have not tested the Camera performance yet. Especially the 4K 60 FPS option. Will do it soon and update the review.Hope this helps!

Extreme graphics and no heating.Charges full 100% in 30 -40 mins. Very fast!6. Amazing camera experience! It's not as best as Google Pixel but then it can be optimised for great shots. 4K videos at 60fps you can take! It's gorgeous.7. 128GB storage!What I didn't like about OnePlus 6T:1. No notification LED due to drop notch.2. Unsure if this is waterproof.3. Volume buttons should have been placed better.4. Pretty heavy phone.5. Reading mode SUCKS! It totally gets like Kindle, all black and white but you can customise it for certain apps.Hope this is a simple review to make your choice.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome product. We got it for 34K. My husband absolutely loves it and he uses it for personal use and for Work. He was really confused about buying 6T or Honor View 20. After his research he made the right choice. Because V20 is piece of garbage for this price. And I don't what people are complaing about.Phone looks great, excellent performance and up to 2 days battery on normal usage (Gaming Not included but game is really nice and smooth on this). Stand by goes to 3. Dash charge is amazing.Most of the people said there are some issue with in-display finger print scanner and it's 1st generation but I feel like it's just as fast of a physical scanner.First get to know the tech before reviewing.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought OnePlus 6 in July ..so after using 8months I came to know that in the beginning camera was good but now it is not... earlier The UI was fast but now it's slow...the space is lot consumed by Android itself .my images and music and other data hardly go above 5gb but now my free space is 35gb out of 64...it never hangs .. battery charging speed is good around 1hr.from 10% to 95%..battery SOT IS 6HRS EARLIER IT WAS 8HRS...back is still as new and OnePlus 6 was great  value for money!!!  But McLaren edition can't justify it's price ...s10e is good competition for OnePlus 6t McLaren...I think s10e is better value for money as it gives water proofing, better display, flagship camera ,fast charger,better one UI ,Dolby sound,akg headphones,IR SECURITY, wireless charging,128gb storage with SD CARD SUPPORT,superslow mode 960p .etc

I said ""Nothing  to worry, this is one plus 6...Best smart phone EVER...it can ve be  carried out in rain...but can't  swim..so Nothing is gonna happen""... But As soon as i took out the phone from my pockets  to show her... Its screem started acting abnormally... blinking and lines and everything...and in no time it lost display... I GOT INSULTED INFRONT OF EVERYONE.. JUST BECAUSE I TRUSTED MY ONEPLUS...YOU KNOW WHAT, I SUGGESTED ALL MY FRIENDS TO BUY ONEPLUS... AND THEY ALL BROUGHT IT... I LL GIVE YO THEIR NUMBERS  YOU CAN CHECk...MANY OF MY FRIENDS  WERE GOING TO BUY UPCOMING ONEPLUS 7, JUST BECAUSE I WAS TALKING TOOOO MUCH ABOUT ONE PLUS.....  AND I WAS TOO LOOKING FORWARD FOR IT...It took me 4 months of hardwork to rise up 40,000 rupees to join Oneplus Family, niw its gonna cost me moe...ANYWAY THANK YOU,THANKS ALOT FOR YOUR BETTER SERVICE

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first OnePlus phone and boy am I surprised how good it is. Here are few things I have found after 5 days of usage:Pros:1. Great Camera - The camera is awesome in this phone. I have attached few pics taken from this phone and they look great. The color reproduction is not exactly 100 percent but very close. The images turn out a little bit more colorful than they actually are but they look really good. Selfies in portrait mode are very good and even without the portrait mode they look great. The profession mode is wonderful if you can take some time learning how to use it. The pic of the mango that I have posted was taken in the professional mode. The HDR mode produces good evenly lit pictures - the pic of pink flowers against the sky background and the night mode is a great add on. Videos in 4k 60fps are stunning. This in fact is one of the very few phones out there which can record 4k at 60fps which is usually something that most pricey flagship phones are capable of. There is one thing to be noted here though that the video length cannot be more than 5 minutes. I purchased this phone for the camera and it has not disappointed me ever.2. Good Battery life - With some 4 hours of music listening, 1 hour of browsing and youtube videos, the phone drains by around 70% in 14 hours. The charging is fast.3. Speed - The Phone is very responsive and smooth. Haven't played games yet on it but am sure the phone would be able to handle that with ease. It feels like a fast phone.4. Permium feel - The phone is a little heavier than other phones of almost the same size so feels solid and premium. While some people might feel the lighter the phone is the better it is, it's my personal opinion that a slightly heavier phone feels good.5. Screen - The screen is bright and has stunning clarity.Cons:1. The in-screen fingerprint sensor - This is kind of the weakest link. The finger print sensor is slow. It feels slower than some of the sub 20000 phones out there. Of course this kind of comparison is like apples and oranges because this is an in-screen sensor and I am comparing it with the sensors at the back but still. It feels slow. The face recognition though is zippy and very fast.2. No provision for 3.55 mm jack. So you cannot listen to songs while charging the phone(Unless you have bluetooth headphones of course)Apart from these two things the phone is pretty much complete and at the price at which it is available now, definitely worth the money.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before I write something about the phone or its specs, I would like to say I keep changing smartphone and usually I buy in range of 10K-15K however, since last 1 year no smartphone was fascinating me apart from POCO F1 but already being a MI user ( 6 MI phones used since last 5 years) and few cousins already owning it,  It didn't allow me to buy same. But, I was more concern with the price and then I started searching a lot about all the latest smartphone who has Snapdragon 845 SOC I ended up my search on One Plus 6T.Today, I'm happy enough to share this review after using the device for 3 months. All I would say if you have a budget of 30K then spend some more and go for One Plus 6T as of now.Now Lets talk about pros and cons:Pros:Great battery life With super fast chargingAmazing performance and smart boost featurePremium design with shining glassImpressive rear and front camera with good quality low light capturingIn display fingerprint scanner is really fast and I Love the cosmos effectNo heating at all, I m a pubg lover too.Cons:No headphone jack but you'll get a converter, I wished they could provide ear plug directly instead of converter.No notification LED lightsNo microSD card slot but Its okay I m not much storage guy 128GB is more than enough for me.The major one for me atleast, PRICE I know its a flagship device but I want this at 30KRating as per the usage of last 3 months so far.Weight: 9/10OS: 9/10Screen quality: 9/10CPU: 10/10Performance: 10/10Storage: 10/10 (113 gb almost)Battery: 9/10Rear camera: 9/10Front camera: 8/10In display fingerprint scanner: 9/10Face unlock: 8/10Thanks.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Guys I am the person who buys cell phone in mid-range 10 K to 15K but with amazon Exchange and spending some more bucks brought Oneplus 6T and it amazed me in all aspect, photo quality is superb at given price range, some of features are out of box like dark theme, switching the sim for data usage, easy casting feature from drag down bar  which I use more frequently which is very much user friendly. The phone being given snapdragon processor is very fast also when purchased I filled my phone with my old phone data which took around 50 GB space still the fact it was smooth to navigate across apps.Oneplus could have provided good back cover at least scratch proof one and also it does not justify the mirror back finish of handset. but you can buy one backcover which can do justice to oneplus handset beauty.Over all a good buy and a satisfied user.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this phone on 11th march. I've been using this phone extensively and it was working flawless. But after few days, I noticed there are faint vertical lines showing on display in night when brightness is low and background is grey. I was sure this was display issue on 23rd March which is 12 days after date of purchase, so could not  replace this phone through Amazon. I then raised this issue with OnePlus care, but these guys are just useless. They are not providing replacement for this phone and I would have to get my screen repaired if I want this issue to be resolved.You know when your phone is not even a month old, and you are visiting service centres to get issues fixed, this raises questions about the quality control of the company, and the quality of crappy hardware being used in the device. I had always wanted to buy a OnePlus device, and now I own it, I will never buy any device from OnePlus.
